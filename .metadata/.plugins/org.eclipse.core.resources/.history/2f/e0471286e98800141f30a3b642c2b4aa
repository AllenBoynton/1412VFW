		"Description": "The dog was bred first to bait bulls and bears. When bear-baiting and bull-baiting were deemed inhumane, rat-baiting and dog-baiting became more popular. The APBT Breed was used in both sports, and its prevalence in being put in pits with rats, or other dogs led to \"pit\" being added to its name.",

Thatâ€™s not to say that all pit bulls are the same, but any differences between them have nothing to do with the coloring of the dog.",
